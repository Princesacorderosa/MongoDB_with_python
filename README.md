## Using MongoDB with Python course

This repository contains my exercises for the MongoDB University course "Using MongoDB with Python". 
The course explains how to utilize MongoDB as a backing database for Python applications.  
MongoDB driver documentation website: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/

The course is divided into three units:

### Unit 1: Connecting to MongoDB in Python 
How to connect a Python application to a MongoDB Atlas cluster by using 'pymongo' driver. 

* Lesson 1: Using MongoDB Python Client Libraries  
There are two Python drivers:  
**PyMongo** for synchronous applications and **Motor** for asynchronous applications. 

* Lesson 2: Connecting to an Atlas Cluster in Python Applications  
To install PyMongo 1st need to create a **directory** for the project and 2nd create and activate a **python virtual environment**   
To install the driver and also DNS python, in project directory write:   
<pre>

python3 -m pip install 'pymongo[srv]'
</pre>
